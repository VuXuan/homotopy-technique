* abstract (mentionner la crypto pas clair a cause de la carac. finie?)

* reread the intro.

* in the introduction, "most results could carry over to non-zero
characteristic with suitable modifications."  not clear enough ;
discuss what we should do.

* in the introduction, shouldn't we say that the degree bounds are
  optimal (in the sense that they are reached in generic situations)?
  [just after the sentence starting with Spaenlehauer gave in xxx or
  after the maint theorems?]

* complete complexity statements for in the intro. 

* Prop. prop:compute_regular to be completed
done

* in the intro, shouldn't we draw some explicit applications and consequences
of the results?

* assumption D_2: identify where we prove e >= c
done

* check that we wrote m>=n in Section 3. 
done

* preciser fin de section 3.
done but to be checked -> update statement of Proposition~\ref{prop:compute_regular}

* when we use Prop. 4 in sec. 3, we declare an overhead O(c) but we
  actually apply an overhead O(c^2). Why? 

* changer noms de J_2(\balpha, q), K_2 et J_4 K_4
(numeration etrange)?
