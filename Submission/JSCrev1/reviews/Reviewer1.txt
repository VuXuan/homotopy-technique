Title: Solving determinantal systems using homotopy techniques
Authors: Jon D. Hauenstein, Mohab Safey El Din, Éric Schost, Thi Xuan Vu


In their paper, the authors design probabilistic homotopy algorithms to 
compute all the isolated (or only the simple isolated) solutions of polynomial 
systems involving determinants, which appear both in polynomial optimization 
and computational geometry. They also estimate the complexity of their 
algorithms (i.e. the number of operations in the base field needed to fulfill 
the task) depending on the row and column degrees of the matrix involved, 
on symmetric polynomials in these degrees, in a bound for the number of 
isolated points to be calculated and in parameters associated to the system, 
the size of the matrix involved and the length of  the straight-line program 
evaluating the input polynomials. 

The used data structure consists mainly of straight-line programs and 
zero-dimensional parametrizations to describe zero-dimensional varieties 
by means of univariate polynomials and a linear form, tools already common 
in this kind of algorithms and that often lead to better complexity bounds 
than the general ones.

First they give a result that decides whether a point is isolated or not 
in a variety provided a bound for its multiplicity if it is isolated is given. 
This result adapts a previous one by B. Mourrain. 
They also adapt the construction by Mourrain in order to obtain a better complexity. 

Then some dimension and unmixedness properties on particular determinantal 
ideas are stated and proved. Afterwards, they construct standard homotopies
and prove that well-posed starting systems satisfy conditions on number of 
solutions and multiplicity. 

They give determinantal homotopies algorithms based on Newton iteration starting 
from a well posed system. Finally they bound the complexity of their algorithms 
in terms of the column degrees of the matrix involved and afterwards, for the 
row degrees of the matrix involved. 

Finally, in an appendix, they prove some generic properties of the homotopy 
starting systems involved which are needed for their algorithms to work. 
	
The general idea underlying the paper is standard: to find some nice starting 
systems for the homotopies, use Newton-Hensel approximation, and recover the 
information of the system they want to “solve”. In the particular context of the 
paper, there are many properties to prove, and some difficulties to tackle that 
are dealt with very well. In this sense, the paper contains some new and 
interesting results that deserve to be published. 
However I would like to read a revision before accepting it for publication. 

Some details:
 
In the abstract, it would be nice to make clear that these computations work 
under certain conditions for p, q, n and s. 

Perhaps a comparison with already known algorithms solving this task 
(for example, how the author’s algorithms compare with Lecerf’s equidimensional 
decomposition algorithm) should be made. The symmetric polynomials involved 
in the complexity imply the complexities may be exponential in the degrees involved.  

The introduction is rather long. I suggest to revise it and to make it shorter 
if possible. 

In p. 2, l. 29 the authors state “this notion makes sense for any field K; 
when K = R, these points are indeed isolated for the metric topology”. 
This statement is misleading. In fact, the algorithms they design find the 
isolated solutions in an algebraically closed field if I am right, and they may 
skip isolated solutions in R because they are not isolated in C. 

In p. 6, l. -15, “g_i can be discarded”: clarify, please, if one discards one 
or more polynomials, the condition n = q-p+s+1 is lost. 

In page 9, Proposition 7 is rather theoretical, because it works with operations 
in L and not in K. In fact, I do not understand the role K plays in this 
construction. Moreover, how is the point x given? How can you codify a particular 
point with coordinates in an algebraic closure of an effective field? 
As a theoretical result, I think it works, but then, when it is used in page 23, 
I do not know how it is applied when working with zero-dimensional 
parametrizations. Please, clarify. 

In page 22, clarify the dynamic evaluation technique, please: I suppose you 
are computing polynomial gcd when you find a zero-divisor. Is this taken into 
account in the complexity stated there? Or you are tackling it some other way?

The rest of the paper is OK, I think. It is nice to have an example, although 
the lack of polynomials G in it is somewhat disappointing.

I have found some typos but I will mark them more thoroughly in my next revision.
