* Review 1

** In the abstract, it would be nice to make clear that these computations work
under certain conditions for p, q, n and s. 

=> DONE

** Perhaps a comparison with already known algorithms solving this task 
(for example, how the author’s algorithms compare with Lecerf’s equidimensional 
decomposition algorithm) should be made.

=> DONE

** The symmetric polynomials involved 
in the complexity imply the complexities may be exponential in the degrees involved.  

=> DONE

** The introduction is rather long. I suggest to revise it and to make it shorter 
if possible. 

=> DONE

** In p. 2, l. 29 the authors state “this notion makes sense for any field K; 
when K = R, these points are indeed isolated for the metric topology”. 
This statement is misleading. In fact, the algorithms they design find the 
isolated solutions in an algebraically closed field if I am right, and they may 
skip isolated solutions in R because they are not isolated in C. 

=> DONE

** In p. 6, l. -15, “g_i can be discarded”: clarify, please, if one discards one 
or more polynomials, the condition n = q-p+s+1 is lost. 

=> DONE

** In page 9, Proposition 7 is rather theoretical, because it works with operations 
in L and not in K. In fact, I do not understand the role K plays in this 
construction. Moreover, how is the point x given? How can you codify a particular 
point with coordinates in an algebraic closure of an effective field? 
As a theoretical result, I think it works, but then, when it is used in page 23, 
I do not know how it is applied when working with zero-dimensional 
parametrizations. Please, clarify. 

=> DONE (to be checked)

** In page 22, clarify the dynamic evaluation technique, please: I suppose you 
are computing polynomial gcd when you find a zero-divisor. Is this taken into 
account in the complexity stated there? Or you are tackling it some other way?

DONE

** The rest of the paper is OK, I think. It is nice to have an example, although
the lack of polynomials G in it is somewhat disappointing.

** I have found some typos but I will mark them more thoroughly in my next revision.  


* Review 2

** (1) The total length of this paper is 60 pages.
Already the introduction takes up almost 9 pages.

=> Now it is 6 pages.

The appendix starts at page 48.
Section 5 with the determinantal homotopy algorithm starts 
only at page 21.  Given that this algorithm could also be suitable
for a numerical, practical implementation, the paper would have been
more appealing to read if the steps in the homotopy algorithm would have
been illustrated on the running example and if the cost analysis,
which is specific to the formalism of straight-line programs would follow.

** (2) The reference list is incomplete.  The authors cite [65], marking it 
as "One notable exception", but a precursor to those homotopies are the 
Pieri homotopies, which solve the output pole placement problem in linear
systems control, SIAM J. Control Optim. 38(4): 1265-1287, 2000. 
Example 3.3 on page 257 of ACM TOMS Algorithm 795: PHCpack, 1999,
briefly outlines the simplest instance.

=> A Citer. DONE.

As to this "so-called BKK bound" phrase in the submitted paper,
every polynomial has a Newton polytope, and polyhedral homotopies 
are generically optimal for sparse systems.
With the introduction of slack variables (as in the embeddings of
Journal of Complexity 16(3):572-602, 2000), polyhedral homotopies
apply just as well to overdetermined polynomial systems.

=> DONE

To illustrate the point that polyhedral homotopies are relevant both
to numerical and symbolic computing, consider the paper "Deformation 
techniques for sparse systems," Found. Comput. Math., 9:1-50, 2009.

=> We already cite it.

** (3) One major weakness in this paper, compared to [65], is that no 
computational results with an efficient implementation of the algorithms
proposed in this paper are known.  There is no point in citing [14], as
[14] is irrelevant to Schubert problems and symbolic homotopy continuation.

** Small comment: The word probabilistic should better already appear in the abstract.

DONE
